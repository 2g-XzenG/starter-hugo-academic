I am currently a XXX since XXX. I received my PhD degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science @ Ohio University in 2021. My advisor was Prof. Chang Liu. Before that, I obtained M.S. from Ohio University and B.S from University of Science and Technology Beijing.

My research interests broadly are data mining and artificial intelligence, including healthcare, natural language processing, and education.
